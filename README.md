# LOLIN-S3-MINI-PRO
WiFi & Bluetooth 5 (LE) development boards based on ESP32-S3FH4R2.

This repository contains a collection of small experiments that showcase the
board's screen and 6D MEMS IMU (QMI8658C). These examples use the sensor data to
determine orientation and motion in order to provide interactive demos.

Planned experiments include:

* **Bouncing balls** – tilt or swing the board to move the balls around.
* **Magic 8 Ball** – shake the board to reveal a random message that floats up
  on the screen.
* **Marble maze** – use the board's orientation to roll virtual marbles through
  a maze.
* **Star field** – navigate a field of stars, where the direction of travel is
  based on how the board is held.
* **3D cube rotation** – rotate a cube in response to the board's movement.
* **Fluid simulation** – pixels flow and bounce around the screen according to
  the board's motion.
